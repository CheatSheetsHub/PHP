# BASICS

Including PHP in a File

<?php // place PHP code here ?>

Writing Comments
//

Denotes comments that only span on one line
#

Another way of producing single-line comments

/*...*/

Everything between /* and */ is not executed, also works across

several lines

# Types of Data

### Integers

Integers are non-decimal numbers between -2,147,483,648 and

2,147,483,647. They must have at least one digit and no decimal point.

Can be in decimal, hexadecimal or octal.

### Floats

This is the name for numbers with a decimal point or in exponential
form.

### Strings

This simply means text, we will talk about it in detail further below.
Boolean values

Meaning true/false statements.

### Arrays
Arrays are variables that store several values. We will talk about
them in detail further below.

### Objects
Objects store both data and information on how to process it.

### Resources
These are references to functions and resources outside of PHP.

### NULL
A variable that is NULL doesn’t have any value.

# Variable Scope

function myFunction() {

global $a, $b;

$b = $a - $b;

}

# Predefined Variables

### $GLOBALS
Used to access global variables from anywhere inside a PHP script.
### $_SERVER

scripts.

form.

# STRINGS
### Defining Strings

Single quotes
This is the simplest way. Just wrap your text in ' markers and PHP
will handle it as a string.
 Double quotes

As an alternative you can use ". When you do, it’s possible to use the
escape characters below to display special characters.
heredoc

Begin a string with <<< and an identifier, then put the string in a
new line. Close it in another line by repeating the identifier.
heredoc behaves like double-quoted strings.
nowdoc

Is what heredoc is for double-quoted strings but for single quotes. It
works the same way and eliminates the need for escape characters.

# Escape Characters
\n — Line feed
\r — Carriage return
\t — Horizontal tab
\v — Vertical tab
\e — Escape
\f — Form feed
\\ — Backslash
\$ — Dollar sign
\’ — Single quote
\" — Double quote
\[0-7]{1,3} — Character in octal notation
\x[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,2} — Character in hexadecimal notation
\u{[0-9A-Fa-f]+} — String as UTF-8 representation

# OPERATORS
### Arithmetic Operators
+ — Addition
- — Subtraction
* — Multiplication
/ — Division
% — Modulo (the remainder of value divided by another)
** — Exponentiation

### Assignment Operators
+= — a += b is the same as a = a + b
-= — a -= b is the same as a = a – b
*= — a *= b is the same as a = a * b
/= — a /= b is the same as a = a / b
%= — a %= b is the same as a = a % b

### Comparison Operators
== — Equal
=== — Identical
!= — Not equal
<> — Not equal
!== — Not identical
< — Less than
> — Greater than
<= — Less than or equal to
>= — Greater than or equal to
<=> — Less than, equal to, or greater than
Logical Operators
and — And
or — Or
xor — Exclusive or
! — Not
&& — And
|| — Or

### Bitwise Operators
& — And
| — Or (inclusive or)
^ — Xor (exclusive or)
~ — Not
<< — Shift left
>> — Shift right


### Error Control Operator
You can use the @ sign to prevent expressions from generating error
messages. This is often important for security reasons, for example to
keep confidential information safe.
Execution Operator

PHP supports one execution operator, which is  (backticks). These
are not single-quotes! PHP will attempt to execute the contents of the
backticks as a shell command

Increment/Decrement Operators
++$v
Increments a variable by one, then returns it
$v++
Returns a variable, then increments it by one
--$v
Decrements the variable by one, returns it afterward
$v--
Returns the variable then decrements it by one


### String Operators
.
Used to concatenate (mean combine) arguments
.=
Used to append the argument on the right to the left-side argument

# LOOPS IN PHP
For Loop
for (starting counter value; ending counter value; increment by which
to increase) {
// code to execute goes here
}
Foreach Loop
foreach ($InsertYourArrayName as $value) {
// code to execute goes here
}
While Loop
while (condition that must apply) {
// code to execute goes here
}
Do..While Loop
do {
// code to execute goes here;
} while (condition that must apply);

# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
If Statement
if (condition) {
// code to execute if condition is met
}
If..Else
if (condition) {
// code to execute if condition is met
} else {
// code to execute if condition is not met
}

If..Elseif..Else
if (condition) {
// code to execute if condition is met
} elseif (condition) {
// code to execute if this condition is met
} else {
// code to execute if none of the conditions are met
}

### Switch Statement
switch (n) {
case x:
code to execute if n=x;
break;
case y:
code to execute if n=y;
break;
case z:
code to execute if n=z;
break;
// add more cases as needed
default:
code to execute if n is neither of the above;
}

# WORKING WITH FORMS IN PHP

Using GET vs POST
GET collects data via URL parameters. That means all variable names
and their values are contained in the page address.
The advantage of this is that you’re able to bookmark the information.
Keep in mind that it also means that the information is visible to
everyone. For that reason, GET is not suitable for sensitive
information such as passwords. It also limits the amount of data that
can be sent in ca 2000 characters.

POST, on the other hand, uses the HTTP POST method to pass on
variables. This makes the data invisible to third parties, as it is
sent in the HTTP body. You are not able to bookmark it.

With POST, there are no limits to the amount of information you can
send. Aside from that, it also has advanced functionality and is
therefore preferred by developers.
Form Security
PHP offers tools to thwart those attacks, namely:
htmlspecialchars()
trim()
stripslashes()
Required Fields, Error Messages and Data Validation
Aside from that, PHP is able to define required fields (you can’t
submit the form without filling them out), display error messages if
some information is missing and to validate data. We have already
talked about the necessary tools to do so.
For example, you can simply define variables for your form fields and
use the empty() function to check if they have values. After that,
create a simple if/else statement to either send the submitted data or
output an error message.
The next step is to check submitted data for validity. For that, PHP
offers a number of filters such as FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL to make sure
a submitted email address has the right format.

# Regular Expressions (RegEx)
Syntax
$exp = "/w3schools/i";
RegEx Functions
preg_match()
Returns 1 if the pattern was found in the string and 0 if not
preg_match_all()
Returns the number of times the pattern was found in the string, which
may also be 0

preg_replace()
Returns a new string where matched patterns have been replaced with
another string

### RegEx Modifiers
i
Performs a case-insensitive search
m
Performs a multiline search (patterns that search for the beginning or
end of a string will match the beginning or end of each line)
u
Enables correct matching of UTF-8 encoded patterns

### RegEx Patterns
[abc] - Find one character from the options between the brackets
[^abc] - Find any character NOT between the brackets
[0-9] - Find one character from the range 0 to 9

# Metacharacters
|
Find a match for any one of the patterns separated by | as in:
cat|dog|fish
.
Find just one instance of any character
^
Finds a match as the beginning of a string as in: ^Hello
$
Finds a match at the end of the string as in: World$
\d
Find a digit
\s
Find a whitespace character

\b
Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the
end of a word like this: WORD\b

\uxxxx
Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx
Quantifiers
n+
Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*
Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?
Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
n{x}
Matches any string that contains a sequence of X n's
n{x,y}
Matches any string that contains a sequence of X to Y n's
n{x,}
Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least X n's


# Grouping
Use parentheses ( ) to apply quantifiers to entire patterns. They cal
also be used to select parts of the pattern to be used as a match.
<?php
$str = "Apples and bananas.";
$pattern = "/ba(na){2}/i";
echo preg_match($pattern, $str); // Outputs 1
?>


# PHP Functions
● A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly
in a program.
● A function will not execute automatically when a page loads.
● A function will be executed by a call to the function.
Syntax

code to be executed;
}
